                         exercise got introduced or the related lecture was given (see *Activities* column of the
                         [course plan]({{< ref "/lessons" >}}))
                         


## Requirements

### Formal

* language: German or English
* put all exercise solutions together in one dedicated repository 
* use a folder per exercise solution named after the exercise
* hand in the link to the repository [before deadline expires]({{< link-to-dates-of-current-semester >}})
* the repository may not be public in case some log files contain sensitive data


### Content

* each solution folder contains:
  * all *deliverables* (see respective section in the exercise description)
  * documentation if necessary for reviewing 
  * any other file necessary to complete the exercise


### Remarks

* ‼️ example solutions are just meant as an inspiration, or to unblock in case of being stuck,
  or to better understand the task; it's not meant to be adopted or even copy/pasted and handed in ‼️
* details about deliverables can be found in every exercise description
* `terminal.log` refers to the entire (!) terminal in- & output produced while carrying out
  an exercise, nothing else; which means: no manipulations[^1] at all; only copy as-is (of course, cleansed of
  any encoding artifacts, e.g. ANSI color codes, or other gibberish making the logs not readable)

[^1]: in other words: no censoring, no annotations, no added headlines, comments or newlines, etc.
