Deliverable: Project Implementation
===================================


__SUBMISSION DEADLINE:__ before the end of the day [prior to the first day of review sessions]({{< link-to-dates-of-current-semester >}})


## Requirements

### Formal

* language: German or English
* every line of code and documentation is stored and tracked in an accessible version control system
* hand in (a) link(s) to the repository/repositories
* each code base contains a `README.md` which includes an onboarding section
* starting from scratch each step taken towards the final state of the overall infrastructure setup must be
  comprehensible (to ensure fair evaluation/grading)
* every relevant (terminal) command must be made transparent & verifiable, e.g. in documentation a/o dedicated
  files (e.g. pipeline code, shell script, `Makefile`, etc.)


### Technical

* follow the *Infrastructure-as-Code* paradigm, meaning: write code rather than words explaining the necessary steps
* cloud-, self- or locally hosted
* all relevant services (VCS, CI/CD, App, Monitoring) need to be accessible via FQDN
* the application and each service provisioned by yourself must be served via _HTTP**S**_ (HTTP over TLS)
* CI is only triggered through a change in the VCS
* deploying to the *production* environment must involve a manual review/approval/release process
* application must run 100% redundant (scaled horizontally with a replication factor of at least *2*)
* when deploying a new version, the app must continue to be reachable (zero-downtime deployment); this
  depends on the deployment strategy that has been chosen
* for the sake of simplicity, the state of the application's persistence layer can be considered
  ephemeral/transient, which means data may get lost when services representing said layer get restarted,
  nevertheless they still have to be part of the overall setup, and thus of the infrastructure and
  automation code
* invite lecture to the project(s) and assign owner / administrative permissions


### Content

* the application is put through at least 3 stages (build, test, deploy) by at least 1 pipeline (CI/CD)
* at least one service (e.g. VCS, Monitoring) other than the application has to be provisioned by yourself (no
  third-party as-a-service solution)
* automate the allocation and configuration of all required infrastructure components


### Additional notes

* making the deliverable comprehensive means, one must be able to reproduce the entire setup solely by having the
  repositories content available, so that at the end the entire setup is functional as intended
* it's not necessary to implement any exporter logic into the application code in order to get some monitoring 
  working; there are other components of your infrastructure to collect metrics from, if the chosen *application*
  does not expose any
