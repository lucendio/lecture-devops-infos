Deliverable: Research Nodes
===========================


__SUBMISSION DEADLINE:__ before the end of the day at which the [classroom discussion takes place]({{< link-to-dates-of-current-semester >}})


## Requirements

### Formal

* language: German or English
* format: Markdown (or reStructuredText)
* put the research notes in a separate file for each statement
* name the files based on the following scheme `notes_statement-${STATEMENT-NUMBER}_${STUDENT-ID}.md`
  (`STATEMENT-NUMBER` format: two digits - add leading `0` if necessary, e.g. `7` --> `07`)
* publish your notes in the same repository (push directly to the mainline[^1] branch) that also contains
  the list of statements (store the files right next to the list) 
* *[optional]* use the given template `notes_template.md` (located in the respective research repository) to
  structure your notes 
* relevant links can either be added inline or in the dedicated section
* write bullet points (notes) not a novel

[^1]: this way it's ensured that statements are not chosen more than once, at least not without any evidence


### Content

* What is the message/meaning/advice behind the statement?
* Put the statement in some context
* Assess the statement and state your own opinion
* Is it a good or a bad idea? Why? Or, maybe both?
* Make your conclusions transparent and traceable
* Are your conclusions plausible?
