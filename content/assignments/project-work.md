Project Work 
============


__Description:__ Implement the software life cycle for an application of your choosing in a cloud or cloud-simulated
environment. Allocate the underlying infrastructure resources and provision all the services necessary to deploy and
operate said application. Automate the life cycle in a reasonable manner by applying the techniques and practices
taught in this course.

__Deliverables:__ [concept]({{< ref "/assignments/deliverables/project-concept" >}}) &
                  [implementation]({{< ref "/assignments/deliverables/project-implementation" >}})

__Requirements:__ hand in an initial version of the [concept]({{< ref "/assignments/deliverables/project-concept" >}})
                  before the [deadline expires]({{< link-to-dates-of-current-semester >}})

{{< hint warning >}}
Please note, that it's not required to completely finish the implementation in order to pass
the course (grade: `4.0`).
{{< /hint >}}


## Process

1. write a [concept]({{< ref "/assignments/deliverables/project-concept" >}}) and hand in an initial version before the 
   given [deadline]({{< link-to-dates-of-current-semester >}})
2. receive initial feedback and sanity-check in written form via email
3. check in last commit of the [implementation]({{< ref "/assignments/deliverables/project-implementation" >}}) before
   the [*code freeze* deadline]({{< link-to-dates-of-current-semester >}})
4. hand in the links to the [implementation]({{< ref "/assignments/deliverables/project-implementation" >}})
   via email right after *code freeze* 
5. present your [implementation]({{< ref "/assignments/deliverables/project-implementation" >}}) in a scheduled review
   session

Eventually, you'll end up with two repositories:

(1) a fork of the application that you [chose]({{< ref "/faq/assignments#app-for-project" >}})
    to deploy in this assignment (*fork* as in __`git clone`__, don't copy content of another repository;
    __rebase regularly__ to upstream)

(2) the source code that defines your infrastructure, its documentation, and the
    [concept]({{< ref "/assignments/deliverables/project-concept" >}})


## Specifications

### Components

* Application (+ backing service)
* Version control system
* Automation system
* Target environments (*non-production* and *production*)
* Monitoring

You are free to choose any available technology to implement the project, as long as all requirements are being met.  

{{< hint info >}}
For more details and specifications of the deliverable(s) and their requirements, please refer the
corresponding document(s) [here]({{< ref "/assignments/deliverables" >}})
{{< /hint >}}


### Application conditions

* the host system or runtime environment of the application or any other service must be 
  [POSIX-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#POSIX-oriented_operating_systems)
  (e.g. Linux, BSD, macOS)
* the source code of the application is part of the deliverable, and thus must not be proprietary or
  confidential in any way 
* the application must depend on at least one backing service (e.g. database to persist data, an email server
  to send out notifications, etc.)


## Review

* it's going to be a remote 1:1 session
* time slots are assigned in advance through a self-service online poll  
* demonstrate the entire life cycle iteration by introducing an actual change to the application source code
* verify the existence of every service


## Teams

* it's allowed to work in a team (â‰¤ 2 people), but not required
* register the team before [the deadline expires]({{< link-to-dates-of-current-semester >}})
* the workload of a team is expected to be the pre-defined workload of a single person
  multiplied by the amount of team members
