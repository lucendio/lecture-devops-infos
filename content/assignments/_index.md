Assignments
===========


During this course, you are asked to do a couple of assignments in order to pass the course and receive a grade:

* [Project]({{< ref "/assignments/project-work" >}})
* if necessary, a [retry exam]({{< ref "/assignments/retry-exam" >}}) (2nd attempt)

Your grade is based on the outcome of the [*Project*]({{< ref "/assignments/project-work" >}}). To be permitted to hand
in that assignment, you first have to write a [*concept*]({{< ref "/assignments/deliverables/project-concept" >}}).

{{< hint info >}}
Please note, that as soon as you have handed in a first version of the [*concept*]({{< ref "/assignments/deliverables/project-concept" >}}),
you are obliged to receive a grade for this course, or in other words: your attempt to pass the course has started
and grading is inevitable.
{{< /hint >}}

Should you not pass the [*Project*]({{< ref "/assignments/project-work" >}}) assignment, you are free to take a
*[retry exam]({{< ref "/assignments/retry-exam" >}})* in order to still pass the course.


## Indication of source

Every line of code or text that is not a result of your own thought process (your own brainchild), requires a reference
of origin provided in-place; e.g. 

* deep link to the respective section of a web page
* a link to a video including the respective time code

If code or text was actually written by yourself but originates from utilizing tools based on *machine learning*
(commonly known as *artificial intelligence*, such as *large language models* etc.) the entire uncensored prompt
(input & output history) must be provided:

* put the prompt history for each line of code (block) or sentence (or paragraph) in a separate text file
* provide a reference to the file in-place right before the lin(s) in question

{{< hint danger >}}
Generally speaking, it must be made obvious to the reader, which line(s) - or sentences in case of concept or
documentation text - are affected by sources mentioned above, otherwise the deliverable __will be classified as
fraud attempt and reported__.
