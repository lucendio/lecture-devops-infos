Hey, there! ðŸ‘‹
==============


## What's this about?

This website is the main entry point for the *DevOps* course. It's supposed to help
you discover all the provided materials and explains how this course is organized.


## Prerequisites

* not afraid of the terminal or command-line interfaces
* [prior knowledge]({{< ref "/guide/prior-knowledge" >}}) of Unix-like operating systems (e.g. `$PATH`, file permissions)
* some experience with Version Control Systems (e.g. [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc))

{{< hint info >}}
Experience from previous semesters show that working on a Windows machine
might become tedious and could even result in data loss (invoking `make` in path
containing white spaces). For possible solutions, please refer to the
[FAQ]({{< ref "/faq#linux-on-windows-workstation" >}})
{{< /hint >}}

[^1]: there is a [section in the guide]({{< ref "/guide/prior-knowledge" >}}) to help you get up to speed, if you're
missing some pieces


## How to get started?

Have a look into the FAQ section: [Where do I even start?]({{< ref "/faq/#where-do-i-start" >}}).
