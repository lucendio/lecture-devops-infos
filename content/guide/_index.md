===============


{{< hint warning >}}
The content of this document is not finite but also not updated regularly
{{< /hint >}}

This guide should give some advice on how to approach the [*project*]({{< ref "/assignments/project-work" >}})
assignment and how to deal with certain barriers you might face along the way.
Depending on which approach you choose, the content may be applicable only to a certain extent. It
is based mostly on personal experience and thus somewhat opinionated. You are more than welcome to
walk your own path.
