{{< /hint >}}

*Format: `TERM(*) [ABBREVIATION]: DEFINITION`*

__environment*__ [env]: a *single installation* (or instance) of an application/service, all its *backing services*
    and, at least to some extend, the infrastructure that is hosting all of it. Some resources/services might me shared
    across environments. The purpose(s), requirement(s) and thus the accessibility of an environment may vary.
    (Examples: production, staging, test, development, local) 

__infrastructure*__ [infra]: (A) the physical/virtual resources (machines, network) one or more environments are running
    on and, to some extent, (B) services that are necessary to facility environment(s), such as load balancer, CI/CD, or
    VCS

__stack/toolchain*__: a set of technologies (software a/o hardware), that describes the composition/architecture of, for
    example, the infrastructure (i.e. infrastructure stack) and maybe how it's set up. Each item represents a dependency
    to the overall setup

__local environment*__: refers of a toolchain that facilitates developing software a/o infrastructure code on a local
    computer. The locally instantiated environment is called the same. For example, it consists of a virtual machine
    simulating (a portion of) the actual remote setup.

__allocate*__: creates or instantiates infrastructure resources (e.g. machines, network, storage, managed services)

__configure*__: installs software and adjusts (system) configuration on resources in order to give purpose to them;
    precedes allocation

__provision*__: combines the processes of allocating & configuring. While allocating is more related to (possibly
    virtualized) hardware resource, e.g. virtual machines, and (managed) services, whereas configuring manages what's
    being put on top of these resources

*(Fig[1]: Vocabulary, scenarios & technologies set into relation)*

[__Infrastructure-as-Code__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) [IaC]: define the desired state of
    your infrastructure in source code. Common best practices in *Software Engineering* can, thereby, be applied.

[__Greenfield project__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project): A project started from scratch that doesn't
    have any dependencies yet, and hence no limitation regarding these decisions.

__Version Control System__ [VCS]: software to manage source code versioning, that enables collaborative editing and
    helps to integrate changes into the code base 

__Source Control Management__ [SCM]: see *VCS*; not to be confused with *Software Configuration Management*

[__system/application development life cycle__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle) [SDLC]:
    represents the process, and therefore describes every aspect, of software creation, delivery, updating, and even
    transition or retirement

[__Software Configuration Management__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_configuration_management) [SCM]: refers
    to the process of organizing and controlling software changes as part of the *SDLC*, e.g. prioritizing & ordering, 
    bug tracking, versioning, releasing & rollout, environment settings

__microservice__: A design pattern for software architecture and the counterpart to a 
    [monolithic approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application). Following this, it turns pieces of an
    application into services, in order to archive a loose coupling (e.g. communicate through web APIs) 

__[service discovery](https://www.nginx.com/blog/service-discovery-in-a-microservices-architecture/)__: ephemeral
    instances naturally result in network addresses become dynamically allocated. In a microservice architecture, a
    client (e.g. *serviceA*) needs to know the address of the server (e.g. *serviceB*) in order to communicate.
    Therefore, the system requires a way to discover/query such addresses. There are at least 2 patters for such a
    process: (a) client-side discovery and (b) server-side discovery. In either of them, generally, some kind of
    *load balancing* is involved.

[__12-Factor-App__](https://12factor.net) [12-Factor]: a set of best practices to build software-as-a-service solutions
    for cloud-native environments, but also recognized as *good application design principles* in general

[__backing service__](https://12factor.net/backing-services): a service, that is consumed (a.k.a. dependent on) by
    another service/process/application

__scale vertically__: modify the available resources (processor, memory, storage, uplink) of an instance (a.k.a. scale up)

__scale horizontally__: modify the amount of instances and distribute load (a.k.a. scale up)

__ephemeral__: a process/service/instance has no persistent state (e.g. sessions), thus no need to be petted or make it
    last; this characteristic, i.a., makes it effortless to scale horizontally

__persistent__: the state of a process/service/instance remains (outlives) its shutdown/restart (a.k.a. *stateful*);
    opposite of *ephemeral*

__idempotent__: repeated execution or application results in the same state. Typically, referred to in the context of 
    *Configuration Management*

__workload__: any kind of program that requires computation, terminating or non-termination, non-native to its
     surrounding context, but executed within it; referred to, e.g, in the context of *Kubernetes*

[__automation__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation): reduce human effort/interaction/involvement in a rather
    complex procedure to an absolute minimum. Such procedure can be triggered in various ways, e.g. certain change in
    sensor metrics, specific output of another automated procedure, or even manually by a human. The idea of
    automation does not imply any specific way of how a procedure is being triggered nor does it make any assumption
    about where its being executed.   

__Automation platform/system__ [CI/CD]: helps to manage & facilitate the automation of steps in a *SDLC*, e.g. build,
    test, or deploy. It runs as a service that is usually accessing but also accessed by other services within an
    infrastructure setup.   

[__Continuous Integration__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) [CI]: as part of an automation tool,
    it runs [integration tasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_integrator) unattended, e.g. merge, build, test  

__Continuous Delivery/Deployment__ [CD]: as part of an automation tool, it runs tasks either to ensure that the software
    is in a deployable state (Continuous Delivery), or to actually release and deploy the software (Continuous Deployment) 

__exporter__: makes data (metrics, logs) available or even sends it proactively to one ore more collectors (push pattern)

__collector__: place, where all monitoring data comes together. Consists of storage and maybe logic (in case of polling)

[__Fully qualified domain name__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) [FQDN]: consists of at least
    the *hostname* and one higher level (or top-level) domain (short: TLD) separated by a '.' (dot);
    e.g. `my-domain-name.tld`

__machine__: physical (aka. bare-metal) or virtual computer running a full-featured (own kernel) operating system

__virtual machine__ [VM]: emulation (software-defined) or virtualization of a machine and the hardware "underneath" 

__Cloud provider__: an entity that offers a variety of information technology resources on-demand for money. Examples
     (unsorted): DigitalOcean (DO), Hetzner, Amazon Web Service (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure

__Kubernetes__ [K8s]: open source container orchestration platform; managed versions are offered by public cloud provider,
    such as [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/), Google: [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/),
    Amazon (AWS): [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), Azure (Microsoft): [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/)

__Elasticsearch+Fluentd+Kibana__ [EFK]: technology stack that provides Log Aggregation

__ingress__: incoming traffic (a.k.a. inbound)

__egress:__ outgoing traffic (a.k.a. outbound)

__Containerization__: isolate an application (a.k.a. app, service, process) with the help of container technologies

__[Multitenancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy)__: multiple users (e.g. customers) use & share the same
    infrastructure and its resources (e.g. network) or the same hard- or software instance (e.g. shared workspace).
    Those *tenants* neither can 'see' or may know about each other, nor access the *space / scope* from one another

__atomic__: in the context of states and state transition, it is the *'smallest'* change possible to be applied w/o
    ever causing the overall system ending up in an inconsistent state. The system is designed in a way that the atomic
    transaction or the state before and after don't have an in-between- or sub-state.

__host__: a machine (physical or virtual) that hosts virtual machines and/or containers. 

__guest__: a virtual machines and/or container running on top of a machine (a.k.a *host*).
