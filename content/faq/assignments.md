## How to choose the application for the project assignment? {id="app-for-project"}

Based on the [conditions]({{< ref "/assignments/project-work#application-conditions" >}}) mentioned in the project
assignment, there are basically three paths: 

1. pick one of the many open source SaaS solutions others have already built (see recommendations below)
2. use the [webservice](https://gitlab.bht-berlin.de/fb6-wp11-devops/webservice) you already know from the
   [exercises]({{< ref "/exercises" >}})
3. choose an application that you already built and/or anyone that is referred to in a tutorial of your favorite
   framework - as long as it adheres to the rules

One way to access your options is to ask yourself: which technology am I most familiar with? Because, you probably
don't want to spend much time on learning about yet another package manager or figure out you to deliver this thing.
In that light, option (1) and (2) have a good chance of being sufficiently documented when it comes to building, testing
and deploying - it's probably more true for option (2).

Here is a small recommendations you might want to check out, if you are going with option (1). More can be found,
for example, in the [Awesome-Selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) list.
